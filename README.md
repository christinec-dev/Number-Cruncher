# Number Cruncher
This repository contains my version of a Simple React Calculator that I made to further my understanding of ReactJs. Unlike my other projects, I'll be the first one to admit that this one's UI is a little poor (I tried to make the calculator look as realistic as possible), but my main focus of this little project was making the calculator work with React on my own, ie. without the help of videos and assistance. 

In this project, instead of doing all the coding for the game on a singular app.js or index.js page, I broke my source code up into their respective component and layout files. I now have a better understanding of how to seperate and intergrate my component files with and from each other, as well as how to better distinguish between Stateless and Functional Components. This calculator is fully functional. You can add, subtract, divide, multiply, modulus, and clear on all operations. I added a bounce effect (CSS Transition) to the heading because I felt bad for not spending more time on the UI, so it is just for creative effects. 

Day two (2) of trying to code in React on my own was a success (view my Tic-Tac-React project for day one here: https://github.com/christinec-dev/Tic-Tac-React) I completed it with the following: React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS and Bootstrap.

#### FUTURE NOTE: 
Later on, when I have more time and understanding, I want to add a function that stores the history of your calculations which can be viewed/deleted when needed.

## My Version UI

## This Project Was Made with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
